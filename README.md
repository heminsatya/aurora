# Welcome to Aurora

Aurora is an MVC web framework for creating CRUD applications quickly and simply.

It based on REST architecture. In another word it is a RESTFUL web framework.

Aurora mostly is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/), and partially have used [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/).


# Installation

You can install Aurora by running:

```
$ pip install aurora-mvc
```


# Usage

## Get Started

To get started with Aurora simply do the following steps:

1. Create the root app (project) directory:

```
$ mkdir my_app
```

> Here *my_app* is a variable name. Change it to anything of your choice at any time you want.

2. Install a python virtual environment in the same path that the project directory exists:

```
$ python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

**Linux / Mac:**

```
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**

```
$ venv\scripts\activate
```

4. Navigate to the project directory:

```
(venv) cd my_app
```

> Notice that the project directory must be empty, otherwise you will get an error on the next step.

5. Initialize the root app with Aurora via python shell:

```
(venv) python
>>> from aurora import init_app
>>> init_app.start()
```

> Congratulations! You successfully initialized the root app. Now you are ready to get started with Aurora.

6. To start the root app run the following command:

```
(venv) python app.py
```
